- sensor_log.dat
	The first line describes the sensor used to take the measurements. It contains, separated by a space:
		string type; 		// Letter located at the beginning of each serial sensor log to discern from which sensor the data comes
		float defaultSigma;	// Sensor uncertainty in m (measurement +- uncertainty) TODO 
		float fov;			// Sensor Field Of View (Angle of detection) IN RADIANS!!
		float minRange;		// Sensor minimum distance to detect an obstacle reliably (m)
		float maxRange;		// Sensor maximum distance to detect an obstacle reliably (m)
		Pose sensorPose;	// Relative position and pointing angle of the sensor w.r.t. the axis of the servo
		Vector2D servoCenter;// Relative position of the axis of the servo w.r.t. the body of the robot
		float startAngle;	// Maximum angle (wrt the x axis of the robot) that the servo can point
		float endAngle;		// Minimum .......
		int servoSteps;		// Number of different positions to where the servo can point  	
	The next lines contains:
		-Relative angle between the servo center position and the current position (in radians)
		-Distance to obstacle (in meters)
